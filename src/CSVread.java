/**
 * The CSVread class is responsible for reading a collection's data from a csv
 * file and populating it in either a mutable collection or immutable
 * collection.
 * 
 * The CSVread class is a servant and, therefore, all of its methods are
 * static.
 * 
 * The CSV read class understands the following messages:
 * 1. toMutable(filename)    reads the file, returns a mutable collection
 * 2. toImmutable(filename)  reads the file, returns an immutable collection
